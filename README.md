# Linear-Regression
simple linear regression python project
This is a simple linear regression project that I made to understand basic linear regression and how train and test the model.
I created a simple data set in excel in which I added three columns:
1. Area: area of a house in any unit
2. location: the distance of house from main market in km or m.
3. Price: finally the price according to the area of the house and also according to its location.
